# Thermodynamics-of-Dormitories
A code to model the temperature of a room as a function of time. It solves a first order ODE and uses various inputs about construction materials. 
The idea behind the code is to consider the entire room's temperature to be almost uniform
Use the thermal transfer coefficients of the materials to get an estimate of the ammount of energy that goes in and out of the room
Use this to get the temperature
